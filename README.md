# Python Loops and Functions Project

This repository contains a Python project built in **Google Colab**.  
It demonstrates how to use different types of loops and how to create custom functions in Python.  

---

## üìñ Topics Covered
- For loop examples  
- While loop examples  
- Functions with parameters  
- Functions returning values  
- Combining loops and functions

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the code cells step by step.  
3. Try editing the examples to practice loops and functions.
